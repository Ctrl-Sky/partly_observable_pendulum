Though not the most efficient solution, just using the velocity can easily solve the mountain car using the simple idea:
if velocity is negative go backwards (action = 0)
if velocity is positve go forwards (action = 2)
if velocity is zero you can go forwards or backwards however backwards seems to perform better

When restricted from using velocity and only using position (obersvation[0]), the program is unable to complete the task
