things to try

Increase gen full tree size: first anazlze how large the trees that works are
Increase cross over and decrease mutation chance
maybe get rid of max and cos

add, cond, ang_vel, div, sub, sin, cos, asin, acos, max extend to 35 gen see if it keeps climbing

try adding tan, atan

study one of the short trees with protectedDiv

increase pop size
look to play around with tournmanet
play around with mutation chance 
and play around with finding a pattern for ones that work
