Try training with gravity of 12 and see if it can solve it and then test different gravity
Try training with gravity of 13 and see if it can solve it and then test different gravity

summarize pendulum gravity

grav = 9.81
- works between g = 1 - g = 11
- might work at g = 12

grav = 12
- best is g=1 - g=15
- can still do g=1 - g=12
- begins to start failing the smaller gravity (g=1 - g=9)
- some can only pass the ones around it (g=11, 12, 13)

grav = 13
- can only solve up to g=14
- can go down to g=12
- only one went from g=1 - g=13
- usually only g=12 - g=14

grav = 15
- only works at g=15 mabye g=14
- never g=16
- fails to work on the lower grav becuase too much force used

grav = 16
- exclusively works at g=16

grav = 17
- can not solve

test gravity for grav


structure python files:
helpers.py contain the functions
run.py imports functions from helpers.py and runs, defines main and runs it
make packages (python files in folder with __init__.py)

ideas ive cooked up for file organization
break down into packages
put functions for solving into different modules
put functions for writing to excel and graphs into modules
