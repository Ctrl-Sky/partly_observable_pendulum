for memory remove velocity and try to solve using just observation[0] and observation[1]
1 step 
give it 6 arguments with 2 of them being the common observation[0] and observation[1] and then also pass it the x and y of the
2 previous steps

2 step
Play around with memory such as an external array where the primitives are functions that can read and write from that array

for the part to get the pendulum upright, 
follows the simple premise, if y is posive (aka rises above the x line) action is counter force to whatever direction of movement
Baiscally if its moving clockwise, when y is positive, action is counter clokwise force that still allows the pendulum to swing higher that before
until it reaches the peak

-474 failed     attempted to hold it up but pushed it too far
-413 failed     took too long to bring the pendulum up
-430 passed     balanced it, but let it swing side to side more than normal                  vel(y2, add(add(x2, x2), add(y2, add(x3, x2))), conditional(x2, x3), add(conditional(y2, y3), vel(x1, y2, x3, x3)))
avg = -511

with neg
-468 failed     almost stabilized but too much force and pushed it over
-528 failed     same reason as above
-502 passed     vel(neg(x3), x2, vel(x1, y3, x1, y1), conditional(y2, add(x3, x1)))
-521 failed     failed to stabilize
-509 failed     failed to stabilize
-482 passed     stabilized using max and min torque right after the other  vel(add(x2, conditional(conditional(x2, y3), neg(y2))), y2, add(x2, y1), conditional(y3, y1))
-592 failed     couldn't get the pendulum upright
-624 failed     too slow
-511 failed     passed right at very end but is very slow   vel(neg(x1), neg(y3), conditional(y1, y2), vel(y2, x1, x2, y2))
-303 passed     vel(conditional(conditional(y2, y3), y1), add(conditional(y1, y2), neg(y2)), neg(vel(y3, y3, y2, x2)), add(add(add(x2, x2), x1), conditional(x2, add(conditional(y1, x2), neg(y2)))))
avg = -504
conclusion: the torque used to stablilized the ones that passed was more erratic swaping from low toque to high torque almost instantly,
            a lot less smooth than normal. Other than that, same pass and fail percentage comapred to normal. Will not use as it makes the
            torque act irratically.


with sub
-441 passed     vel(sub(x3, y2), sub(conditional(x2, y3), x3), vel(x3, y2, x3, y2), add(vel(add(y2, y1), conditional(x2, x1), vel(y2, x2, x2, x1), conditional(x2, x1)), y1))
-485 failed     could not stabilize the pendulum, pushed it too far
-466 failed     same as above
-489 failed     same as above
-471 failed     same as above
-560 failed     same as above
-308 passed     yes? held it up at an angle, very shaky add(vel(vel(x2, y1, x3, add(vel(y2, y3, x3, x2), sub(y2, y2))), vel(y1, y2, y2, x2), conditional(x1, sub(conditional(x2, x2), conditional(x3, x1))), y2), add(x3, x2))
-464 failed     the usual
-546 failed     the usual
-445 failed     the usual
avg = 467.5
conclusion: lower avg than usual but less success rate only at 20%. Never lost control of the pendulum (didn't let it swing wildly in cirles)
            but had a lower chance of stabilizing the pendulum. Consider adding it if needed.


with if_then_else
-555 failed     could not get the pendulum upwards
-447 failed     close to stabilize the pendulum but drifted to the left too much
-510 failed     ^^
-494 failed     very weak attempt at stabilizing
-461 failed     very close at stabilizing but right at the end lost control
-805 failed     slow attempt to bring the pendulum up
-411 failed     close but tried to stabilize pendulum when it was at an angle and failed
-784 failed     no attempt at stabilizing pendulum at top
-814 failed     out of control 
-386 failed     very close but couldn't quite stabilize it
conclusion: if_then_else introduces a failure for the pendulum to stabilize itself therefore, should not be used.

with max
-626 passed     vel(max(vel(x3, x1, x1, y1), max(x3, conditional(conditional(x2, x1), conditional(x1, x3)))), add(conditional(y3, max(x3, x2)), max(x2, x3)), y3, vel(add(y3, x2), add(x1, conditional(x2, x2)), max(x3, max(add(y3, x1), max(y2, y3))), max(x1, x3)))
