for memory remove velocity and try to solve using just observation[0] and observation[1]
1 step 
give it 6 arguments with 2 of them being the common observation[0] and observation[1] and then also pass it the x and y of the
2 previous steps

2 step
Play around with memory such as an external array where the primitives are functions that can read and write from that array

for the part to get the pendulum upright, 
follows the simple premise, if y is posive (aka rises above the x line) action is counter force to whatever direction of movement
Baiscally if its moving clockwise, when y is positive, action is counter clokwise force that still allows the pendulum to swing higher that before
until it reaches the peak
